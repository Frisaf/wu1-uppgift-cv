                <hr>
                <p>This is a school project by me, Ash. We were tasked to create a resume for a fictional character in English class, design the logo for it in digital creation (digitalt skapande), and code the website for it in web development class (webbutveckling). I chose to make a resume for Anakin Skywalker, a character from the Star Wars movies. You can find the resume <a href="index.html">here</a>.</p>
                <p>After we were done with the resume, we were supposed to make an application letter for our chosen fictional character. I thought it would be funny if Anakin applied for a job as Jedi Master at the Jedi High Council, because he asks for a place in the council and the rank of Master in the movie, so that is what I wrote. The application letter can be found <a href="application_letter.html">here</a>.</p>
                <p>Right after the application letter and resume was supposed to be handed in, we started making the logos in digital creation/digitalt skapande. I found an appropriate logo that would fit the science fiction theme Star Wars has, and made two lightsabers for the logo. One lightsaber would be blue and the other one red to represent how Anakin was a jedi, but later turned to the dark side. To make this more obvious, I remade his lightsaber in Adobe Illustrator. The logo you see at the top of this page is the finished product.</p>
                <p>To wrap up everything, we were supposed to make a website in web development/webbutveckling for the resume and also the application letter if we wanted to include that as well. This website was supposed to use the logo we created earlier. The website we were supposed to make is the one you are currently on.</p>
