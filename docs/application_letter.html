                <p class="contactDetails">Master Yoda<br>The Jedi Council, The Jedi Temple, Coruscant<br>YODA on hologram</p>
                <p>Dear Master Yoda</p>
                <p>My name is Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight of the Jedi Order, and I am writing to you today, because I saw your advertisement about you searching for a new council member on the hologram poster in the library. I have been a member of the Jedi Order for several years now, and as time has passed I have developed great interest in the Jedi Council and their operations. As such, I would like to apply for the position.</p>
                <p>Throughout the years, I have had a multitude of experiences all over the Galaxy and worked with several different people. As of right now, I have worked as a Jedi Knight for thirteen years and have saved villages from separatist droids, protected senators from assassins and even rescued the Chancellor from villainous forces. In the past, I worked as a junk repairer and I therefore have superior skills in the engineering field.</p>
                <p>I believe myself to be a very patient individual who always thinks first before acting. Furthermore, I am exceptionally skilled in lightsaber fighting, and have taken down several enemies as well as protected millions of people with those skills. However, a lightsaber alone cannot save millions. Without the Force, which I am extraordinarily strong in, I would not have done all the previously mentioned heroic things I have done. Because of my ability to properly channel it, I can help steer the Galaxy towards a brighter future as well as combat the dark side of the Force, which I have also done during the past thirteen years.</p>
                <p>I am also very close to the Chancellor and I believe that by hiring me to this position, I can help strengthen the bond between the Jedi Order and the Senate to further develop our cooperation. I have experience with diplomatic missions and as such I believe I am the perfect fit for providing the council with detailed information regarding the Senate, and vice versa. By further strengthening our bonds, I believe that we will be able to secure peace in the Galaxy, and thus hiring me is a step in that direction.</p>
                <p>I appreciate you taking your time to read this letter, and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. Do not hesitate to contact me, would you have any questions regarding my application.</p>
                <p><em>Yours truly<br>Anakin Skywalker</em></p>
